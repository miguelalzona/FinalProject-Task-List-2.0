Final Project
This is a simple task manager application which enables the user to create/add tasks to complete
Interface is simple and ergonomically friendly where users can view tasks through a series of flashcards displayed below.
The user can just add in details by filling in all the fields which will result in a flashcard being generated.
These flashcards can be clicked on to display the details of the task and can be deleted one at a time with an integrated button interface.
Included in the first release of this application is a display which shows the user the current time with hrs:mins:seconds along with the current day with a personalised message.
This app will still undergo further development with future features to be included on request these may include live weather updates via API or anything to assist functionality with the user.
